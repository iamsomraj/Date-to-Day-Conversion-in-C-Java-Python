# Date to Day Conversion in C Java Python
Date to Day Conversion in C Java Python is used to get the specific day from a date. It can also be used to get the month. I have used Tomohiko Sakamoto’s Algorithm to determine the day.

## Note

Previously, I was using the Zeller's rule. But it was hard to get it right for different languages because of the arithmetic evaluation difference.

Now, I am shifted to Tomohiko Sakamoto’s Algorithm. It is best for programming and does not behave abnormally for different languages. 

Happy coding! 😊
